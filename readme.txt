Code and Data for Identification and Empirical Analysis of 
Amazon EC2 Spot Instance Features for Cost-Effective Tenant Procurement

This repository contains code and data for "Identification and Empirical Analysis of 
Amazon EC2 Spot Instance Features for Cost-Effective Tenant Procurement" (http://www.cse.psu.edu/~bhuvan/CSE-TR-16-006.pdf).

|--- trace analysis
MATLab code and data for prediction of the key features for modeling spot prices. "Lb" denotes the lifetime of a spot instance under bid b and "ES" (or "es") denotes the expected average spot price during Lb.

|--- data store
MATLab code and data for the trace-driven simulation of the in-memory data store case study; python code and input data for the 24-hour real-world experiments on Amazon EC2 using Memcacahed as a case study.

|--- batch processing
MATLab code and code for the trace-driven simulation of the batch processing case study; python code and input data for the 24-hour real-world experiments on Amazon EC2 with synthetic batch jobs (the ami used for batch jobs can be replaced by customized batch jobs).
